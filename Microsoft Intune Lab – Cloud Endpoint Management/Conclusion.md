# Conclusion

The Microsoft Intune lab environment was successfully designed and implemented to demonstrate a complete cloud-based endpoint management workflow. The project centered on **Microsoft Entra ID**, **Microsoft Intune**, and the Windows device **Client01-IT**, providing a practical model of modern device administration without reliance on traditional on-premises infrastructure.

The implementation began with device enrollment, where Client01-IT was joined to Microsoft Entra ID and automatically enrolled into Intune. This established the foundation for centralized management and allowed all subsequent configurations to be applied from a single administrative platform.

Application deployment was performed using Win32 app packaging and assignment through Intune. This validated the ability to deliver software in a controlled and repeatable manner while maintaining visibility into installation status and outcomes.

Security policies were enforced through configuration profiles and security baselines. These settings ensured that the device met defined security requirements, including password controls, Microsoft Defender configuration, and firewall enforcement. The approach demonstrated how Intune replaces traditional Group Policy in a cloud-managed environment.

Compliance policies were implemented to evaluate device health and enforce security standards. Conditional Access was configured to restrict access to organizational resources based on compliance state. This integration between Intune and Entra ID confirmed that access control decisions can be tied directly to device security posture.

Windows LAPS was deployed to manage local administrator credentials. Password rotation and secure storage within Microsoft Entra ID reduced the risk associated with static administrative accounts and demonstrated a key security control for endpoint environments.

Windows Update for Business was configured to manage operating system updates. Update rings controlled deployment timing, restart behavior, and update compliance, ensuring that Client01-IT remained secure and current without manual intervention.

Monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities were validated through the Intune admin center and local diagnostic tools. Device status, policy application, application deployment, and update compliance were all observable through centralized dashboards. Troubleshooting procedures confirmed that issues can be identified and resolved using both cloud-based and local tools.

The completed lab demonstrates a full endpoint lifecycle, from initial enrollment to ongoing management and maintenance. Each section builds on the previous configuration, resulting in a cohesive and functional environment that reflects real administrative practices.

This project provides a clear example of how organizations can manage Windows devices using Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Entra ID. The structure and documentation are designed for repeatability and practical use, making the lab suitable for both learning and portfolio presentation.
